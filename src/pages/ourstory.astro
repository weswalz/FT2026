          Field & Tides opened in Houston's historic Heights neighborhood with a vision to bring
          coastal-inspired dining to the heart of the city.
        </p>

        <h2>The Vision</h2>
        <p>
          Our name reflects our philosophy: "Field" represents locally sourced vegetables, pork,
          poultry, beef, and game, while "Tides" celebrates seafood that is locally sourced from
          the Gulf. This dual focus allows us to honor both land and sea, creating a menu that's
          as diverse as it is delicious.
        </p>

        <h2>Chef Travis Lenig</h2>
        <p>
          Executive Chef Travis Lenig's culinary journey has taken him through some of the finest
          kitchens in the country. His roots stem from his love for many different types of cuisine
          including Southern, Italian, French, and Asian influences. This diverse background creates
          an "open canvas" menu that evolves with the seasons and showcases the best of what's available.
        </p>

        <h2>Our Philosophy</h2>
        <p>
          At Field & Tides, we believe in:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Seasonal Excellence:</strong> Our menus change with the seasons, ensuring the freshest ingredients</li>
          <li><strong>Local Partnerships:</strong> We work closely with local farmers and fishermen</li>
          <li><strong>Sustainable Practices:</strong> We're committed to responsible sourcing and minimal waste</li>
          <li><strong>Culinary Creativity:</strong> Every dish tells a story of land and sea</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>The Space</h2>
        <p>
          Our restaurant embodies the upscale coastal aesthetic—warm, bright interiors with
          natural light, polished restraint, and an atmosphere that's both refined and welcoming.
          Whether you're joining us for brunch, lunch, or dinner, you'll find a space that celebrates
          both the elegance and comfort of coastal dining.
